## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(maps)
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)

head(gapminder)
str(gapminder)


pop2007 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007)

map_world <- map_data("world")

map_pop_2007 <- full_join(map_world, pop2007, by = c("region" = "country"))

ggplot(data = map_pop_2007) +
  aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = pop) + 
  geom_polygon()
```

headYou can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
